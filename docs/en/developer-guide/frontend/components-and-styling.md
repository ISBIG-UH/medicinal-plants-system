# 🧱 Components & Styling

### Components Library

Every project requires some UI components such as modals, tabs, sidebars, menus, etc. Instead of building those from scratch, you might want to use some of the existing, battle-tested component libraries.

In this project we selected [Prime React](https://primereact.org/) a free and open source comprehensive UI components library.

### Styling Solution

To style the application we selected [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) which paradigm is based on the usage of small and reusable CSS classes as building blocks. This tool diminishes the need for custom CSS and thus increasing the consistency of the design system across the application. Also, due to its purge support, only used classes are included in production reducing the styles size which is beneficial in environments with slower internet connection.

Tailwind can be integrated with Prime React by using their passthrough method to override their base theme for a custom one. For more information consult [Prime React's documentation](https://primereact.org/tailwind/)
